- USer preference: odometer/Speed: Change to km/h vs miles
Future idea
- lat and lng is meaningless to most users. Google map Reverse GeoCoding would be a good choice.
- Speed from API is shown as km/h, 
which is not the default units for US users. 
I provded a user preference button to switch from km to mile.
It is currently use browser storage to save preference.
With enough user preference like language, units, etc. Those should be saved 
in DB as a seperate user preference. 
- At this moment, color for each device is randomly generated and reused.
If there are many devices at close approximation, it could cause confusion.
Possible solution is to let User freely choose color or avoid similar color within certain distance
